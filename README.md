# Dart Variable and Control Flow Program

This Dart program demonstrates the use of various data types, control flow structures, and user input handling. It showcases how to define variables, perform type conversions, and utilize loops, conditionals, and switch statements.

## Features

- **Variable Initialization**: Defines and initializes various data types including `int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`, and `List`.
- **Type Conversion**: Implements functions to convert between `String`, `int`, and `double`.
- **User  Input Handling**: Prompts the user for input and provides feedback based on the input.
- **Control Flow**: Uses if-else statements and switch statements to categorize numbers and check conditions.
- **Loops**: Demonstrates the use of for, while, and do-while loops to iterate over numbers.

## Code Overview

The program includes the following key sections:

1. **Variable Definition and Initialization**: 
   - Initializes variables for age, height, name, student status, and hobbies.
   
2. **Type Conversion Functions**:
   - Functions to convert `String` to `int`, `String` to `double`, `int` to `String`, and `int` to `double`.

3. **User  Input**:
   - Prompts the user to enter a number, their age, and a day of the week, providing appropriate feedback.

4. **Loops**:
   - Displays numbers using a for loop, while loop, and do-while loop.

5. **List Iteration**:
   - Defines a list of integers, iterates through it, checks if each number is even or odd, and categorizes it as "small," "medium," or "large."

## Getting Started

To run the program, ensure you have Dart installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

   dart run main.dart

### Instructions for Use:
- Replace `yourusername` and `your-repo-name` in the cloning command with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
- Feel free to modify any sections of the README to better reflect your project's details or your personal preferences!
